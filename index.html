                        <div class="projects-item">
                            I went to Boston in September 2015, to attend the famous <a href="https://hackmit.org/">HackMIT</a>. Partnered with two friends, I helped to create a Pebble App, which is a game teaching Morse Code. We took advantage of the internal motor of the Pebble watch, and used it to generate precise pulses representing a letter or word in Morse Code. We then ask the player to select the right answer among 3 choices. The game also includes a reference for Morse Code, the player could select a letter and learn the corresponding Morse Code by having the watch vibrate it out. This project was surprisingly challenging, I was responsible for creating the UI and user interactions using the C SDK of Pebble. It felt satisfying to play the game, and I also learnt "SOS" in Morse Code.

                            In January 2015, I had the chance of participating in the premier hackthon <a href="http://2015s.pennapps.com/">PennApps</a>. Along with three newly met friends, I contributed to create a <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/helping-hand">solution</a> that allows its users to order food or care packages to be delivered directly to any needy citizen within the hour, through the use of an on-demand courier service. The Android application provides the location data and a variety of preset packages to choose from. Users no longer need to worry about having cash on them or how it might be spent. My main contribution was setting up a <a href="https://github.com/Ze-Q/helpfeedme">Node.js server</a> connected to MongoDB, to allow needy citizens to register their information, such as their name and food allergies, and generate a QR code that is used by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N-foSneEw4">Android App</a>.

                            In late September 2014, I participated in <a href="http://wearhacks.com/">Weahacks</a>, a hackthon dedicated to wearable devices. In a team of four, I helped to implement an Android app called "Myo Workout Monitor" that uses the <a href="https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/">Myo</a> to help patients to perform rehabilitation. The app allows the user to record an exercise, and then monitors the user's range of motion while counting repetitions. I mainly contributed to the backend structure and algorithms. I also practiced some finite-state machine design and pair programming. Check out the demo <a href="http://youtu.be/rNbyS4RBIjs">here</a>.

                            I took part in the biggest hackthon of Canada, <a href="http://hackthenorth.com/">HackTheNorth</a>, in September 2014. Along with three teammates, I built a cloud-based, instant video sharing application called <a href="http://quickvid.me/">Quickvid</a>. Quickvid allows users to record a video in the comfort of their browser and share its link through a text message or email instantly! I contributed significantly to the project: I set up the Node.js server and the Express framework; I wrote the main backend to handle requests and display the main pages; I also designed and implemented the fronted.

                            As the main component of the HCI course I took in winter 2014, this project had the goal of improving post-stroke patients’ balance by guiding them to perform Tai Chi or Tai-Chi-inspired movements, while making the whole experience safe and enjoyable. We started by observing the users, writting personas, researching about current solutions, and proposing a high level design. We then proceeded to make prototypes and perform usability testings in the hospital. After two iterations (one paper prototype and one high-fidelity prototype), we implemented the <a href="https://github.com/Ze-Q/taichi">solution</a>.

Surprised by the lack of classic games on Airspace (the app store for Leap Motion), I decided to combine Space Invaders with the Leap Motion sensor, to allow the users to play this classic (and very addicting) game with their hand instead of a keyboard. I used the LeapJS APIs to pull data from the detector and analyze the inputs. If you own a Leap Motion device and would like to relive this classic game, just connect your device and go <a href="space_invaders/">here</a> to play!!!

                            I participated in the <a href="https://canadianopendataexperience.com/">Canadian Open Code Experience</a> hackthon along with a few friends. Using the <a href="http://data.gc.ca/">data</a> from the government, we created a website that lets the users view the latest food recalls, report food problems they have encountered, and also view the problems reported by other users. Our aim was to help Canadians to avoid hazards related to food safety. I was responsible for the front end of the project. The code is <a href="https://github.com/Ze-Q/Team-Avatar">here</a>.

                        <div class="projects-item">
                            This group project was done as part of the class Introduction to Software Engineering. We were asked to design and implement the classic light racer game (also called TRON), while learning about software development processes and methodologies. From requirement gathering to requirement analysis, software design,  implementation, and testing, I learnt so much from this project, and it was a lot of fun to write a real functional game. I was responsible for the login and score part of the game, I also contributed to the UI. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/Ze-Q/LightRacer"> here</a> (Note: it is optimized for Windows only).

                            As part of a team of 5, I participated in a course competition(Computer Engineering) where we had to design the best mobile gaming device. We did a massive amount of research, and designed the complete specifications for a realistic product, from what it looks like to all the features it has, both hardware and software. I was responsible for researching and designing the software and the battery of the gaming device. I also played the role of team coordinator, and consequently, we were an extremely efficient team. At the end of the semester, we won the contest despite the fierce competition. You can find the design <a href="files/Mayhem.pdf">here</a>.

                            As the main purpose of the course Design Principle Methods, we were required to build an autonomous basketball-playing robot that must have two abilities: score points by throwing balls into the basket, and block an opponent (a robot of another team)’s attempts to score. We were working in teams of 6, and I played the role of Hardware Designer and Tester. Here is a short <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCPfJNtygog">video</a> I made for the project (not for grades, just for fun).

                            As soon as I started cegep, I noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of physical activities we do because we only had 1 weekly gym class (with more theories than exercises), compared to high school where we had 3 gym classes (all exercises, no theories) every week. So I decided to start a Workout&Health Club, which had the purpose of promoting a healthier lifestyle by organizing sportive activities and fruit giveaways. By playing the role of President and organizing the events, I learnt a lot about leadership and most importantly myself, both my strengths and weaknesses. This involvement greatly improved my organizational abilities and also boosted my confidence.

                        <div class="projects-item">
                            As part of a team of about 12 students, I contributed to fundraise over 7000$ through various activities such as talent show, chocolate sales, spaghetti supper, etc. The money was then used to build a preschool in a remote community in Nicaragua. Children at a young age often need to travel a long distance to attend school, so some parents tend to choose not to send their children to school, resulting in these children having low appreciation for education and often choosing to start working at a young age. In 2011, we flew to Nicaragua, and worked at a facility which teaches organic farming to local residents. This trip was incredibly rewarding in many ways, because it not only improved my teamwork and collaboration skills, it also taught me how happiness is not proportional to income.

                        My family immigrated to Canada when I was 11. As we moved around Montreal, I attended several French high schools, until I graduated from École Internationale Saint-Edmond in 2009. I also became a Canadian citizen in 2008.

                    <div class="life-aspect-item">
                        I then went on to attend an English cegep (a special thing in Quebec), Champlain College Saint-Lambert, to study in the International Baccalaureate Pure Science program. 
                    </div>
                    <div class="life-aspect-item">
                        In 2011, I started at McGill University, studying Electrical Engineering. Later on, I discovered my interests in software, so I enrolled myself in a minor of Software Engineering. 
                    </div>
                    <div class="life-aspect-item">
                        In 2013, after having done two internships, I realized that I am more passionate about software, so I switched major and I am now majoring in Software Engineering. 
                    </div>
                    <div class="life-aspect-item">
                        Luckily, the first two years of Electrical Engineering and Software Engineering are quite similar, so I was able to keep the majority of the classes I have done to count towards my Bachelor of Software Engineering. If everything goes as planned, I will be graduating in 2016.
